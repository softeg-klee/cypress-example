# Integration CI

By default, the config file cypress/config/cypress.local.json is used, if you want to use another file 
to switch between environments settings you need to add steps in order :

 1. For example if we need to add env variables to ppd environment, create new file in cypress/config/cypress/ and
  name it cypress.ppd.json
 2. Add new settings to your new file : 
 ```json
    {   
    "baseUrl": "http://generation2024-ppd.paris2024.org.fr",
    "env": {
            "name1": "myvalue"
     }
    }
``` 
 3. Run you test : npx cypress open --env configFile=ppd
 
 # Running tests locally
 
 To run tests locally, run the following command :
```bash
 npx cypress open 
```
by default local env is used


# Update cypress
 
```bash
 npm update cypress
```
